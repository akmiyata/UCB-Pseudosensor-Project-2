# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-2

This is the second project required for Rapid Prototyping of Embedded Interface Designs (ECEA 5347) at the University of Colorado - Boulder, and is very similar in design to the first project. I have included four files:
  1.  UCB-Pseudosensor-Project2.pdf: Project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the UI in several scenarios.
 
# What I learned

Despite the recent upload, it's been awhile since I worked on this project... I was already quite familiar with HTML/CSS, so it was fairly easy to setup a VERY basic UI (normally I'd make the UI "prettier", but time constraints did not allow me to do so... maybe one day...). Tornado Web Server was a new technology for me, but I was already somewhat familiar with client-server communication (via HTTP), so syntax was the only real hurdle there.  I think the biggest takeaway from this project was that it could've been a much quicker and less painful process if I had started with Tornado documentation; tutorials are great, but often times going to the source will give you a much clearer picture that fits your specific needs.
