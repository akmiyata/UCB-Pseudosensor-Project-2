# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-2

This is the second project required for Rapid Prototyping of Embedded Interface Designs (ECEA 5347) at the University of Colorado - Boulder, and is very similar in design to the first project. I have included three files:
  1.  UCB-Pseudosensor-Project2.pdf: Project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the UI in several scenarios.
  2.  index.html: Landing page for the user interface. I chose function over form due to timing constraints; normally this would bother me, but I'm focusing on my current  
      classload and job hunt at the moment.  
  4.  getOne.html: This page displays one set of pseudorandom weather values, generated on the fly. 
  5.  getTen.html: This page displays ten sets of weather values, with timestamps incrementing one second between each reading. Maximum, minimum, and average values are also displayed.
